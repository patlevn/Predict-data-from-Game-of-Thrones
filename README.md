# Predict data from Game of Thrones
This is the analysis used to predict the happenings in Game of Thrones. After analyzing and cleaning up the data, I took book1_A_Game_Of_Thrones, book4_A_Feast_For_Crows, numDeadRelations, popularity, and m_age because they were correlated with each other. 

The process of categorizing data into appropriate categories so that it may be utilized and safeguarded more efficiently is known as data classifciation.

I used scikit-learn to classify data using one of its many classification techniques, such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Classification Trees (CART Models)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM)

Also, I used the tuning parameter to get the best results with Random Forest and GBM.

And in the final result, Tunned Random Forest had the best result and then the Tunned GBM.
